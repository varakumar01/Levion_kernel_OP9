/*
 * These are the optimized functions for reading the PMU/AMU event counters for
 * each supported SoC.
 *
 * The generic timer counter (CNTPCT_EL0) is read directly for the lowest
 * possible latency incurred from reading the current time, as well as the
 * greatest precision since we can convert the number of ticks into nanoseconds
 * without sched_clock()'s approximation that aims to do the conversion as
 * quickly as possible at a loss of precision. The preceeding ISB prevents
 * speculative reads of the counter register, though is unnecessary when
 * CNTPCTSS_EL0 is available (which is indicated at runtime via ARM64_HAS_ECV).
 *
 * Next, the constant cycles counter is read. On CPUs which don't support the
 * AMU constant cycles event, the value from the generic timer counter is used
 * instead. The AMU constant cycles event is useful because it always stops
 * incrementing when the CPU is in WFE/WFI, which can be entered from a number
 * of places in the kernel besides cpuidle, such as __delay(). CPUs which don't
 * support AMU constant cycles only account for WFI from cpuidle; as a result,
 * the CPU frequency calculation for such CPUs may be lower than expected. This
 * is because of unaccounted WFE/WFI activity, since the generic timer counter
 * doesn't stop incrementing in WFE/WFI. This isn't typically a huge problem,
 * but it's worth noting.
 *
 * Then, the CPU cycles are read from AMU event counters on CPUs which support
 * AMU. On SoCs where this isn't the case, the value is read directly from the
 * PMU cycle count register (PMCCNTR_EL0) configured by the PMUv3 driver. This
 * is done directly in assembly rather than using the perf event API in order to
 * achieve the best possible accuracy, since any delays between the counter
 * reads injects inaccuracy into later calculations performed on these values.
 *
 * A succeeding ISB ensures all counter register reads are complete before the
 * CPU proceeds. Any instruction reordering within the ISBs is of negligible
 * consequence, so no barriers are used in between the counter reads.
 *
 * These functions must be noinline in order to force the compiler to align them
 * to an L1 cache line. The goal is to fit all of the MRS instructions in each
 * function into the same cache line, to avoid timing discrepancies between one
 * MRS and another. A stall due to a cache line fill to get the next MRS can
 * influence calculations using these readings; e.g., if the current time is
 * read first and then the current number of CPU cycles is read next after a
 * stall due to fetching the instruction from beyond L1, the resulting CPU
 * frequency calculation from these figures would produce a higher result than
 * expected.
 *
 * None of these functions have stack-allocated variables. Therefore, the
 * prologue of each function may consist of up to two instructions: BTI and
 * PACIASP, from CONFIG_ARM64_BTI_KERNEL and CONFIG_ARM64_PTR_AUTH_KERNEL,
 * respectively. This leaves room for six instructions to be guaranteed to fit
 * within the same cache line as the prologue, which is enough to cover all MRS
 * instruction sequences for every SoC, including ISBs.
 *
 * The resulting counter values are stored into a `struct pmu_stat` using a
 * compound literal to encourage the compiler to reorder or coalesce the stores
 * as it sees fit, without being constrained by any explicit store ordering
 * declared at compile time (e.g., `stat->foo = foo; stat->bar = bar; ...`).
